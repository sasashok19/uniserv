# UniServe

Multi-tenant, AI-powered complaint/feedback portal. Citizens reach out over
Email or WhatsApp (Phase 1 channels; Twitter/IVR/WebChat land in Phase 2);
an AI pipeline confirms their identity, gathers missing details, classifies
and prioritizes the complaint, deduplicates it against existing open
tickets, and routes it into a role-based agent dashboard with a structured
resolution workflow and full audit trail.

## Architecture

Four services, all communicating **asynchronously through an event bus** —
no service calls another's business logic directly.

```

- **api-gateway** (Java 21 / Quarkus) — the only public-facing service.
  Ingests channel messages (IMAP email polling, WhatsApp Meta webhooks),
  authenticates all dashboard traffic via JWT, publishes canonical events to
  the event bus, and exposes the REST API the dashboard calls (tickets,
  agents, tenant config, public citizen status lookup).
- **db-writer** (Java 21 / Quarkus) — the *only* service allowed to touch
  the SQLite file. Everything else reads/writes through its REST API. Runs
  as a single, non-scaled instance (SQLite is single-writer); a Caffeine
  in-memory cache absorbs read load.
- **ai-core** (Python 3.11 / FastAPI) — consumes `channel.message.received`
  events, runs the identity-gate + conversation flow, calls an LLM (OpenAI
  Assistants API, with a deterministic rule-based fallback when no LLM key
  is configured), scrubs PII before any LLM call, classifies/deduplicates/
  prioritizes complaints, and calls back into db-writer to resolve/create
  identities.
- **dashboard** (Next.js 14) — agent-facing PWA (Analytics / Ticket Queue /
  Administration, role-gated) plus a public, unauthenticated, server-rendered
  citizen complaint-status page. Its own Next.js API routes act as a thin
  BFF proxy to api-gateway.

**Single-writer + SQLite WAL:** db-writer runs SQLite in WAL mode (`journal_mode=WAL`,
concurrent readers / one writer), serializes writes itself, and layers a
2-minute-TTL Caffeine cache (max 1000 entries) on reads. If write volume ever
exceeds roughly 5,000/day sustained, the documented migration path is a
Hibernate dialect swap to Postgres — no other service is aware of the
storage engine, since everything goes through db-writer's REST API.

**Everything is multi-tenant.** Every table, every event, and every request
carries a `tenantId` — see [11_MULTI_TENANCY](docs/11_MULTI_TENANCY.md).

## Ports

Identical in both local (no-Docker) and Docker modes, so nothing downstream
changes when you flip `RUN_MODE`:

| Service      | Port | Stack |
|--------------|------|-------|
| api-gateway  | 8080 | Java / Quarkus |
| db-writer    | 8090 | Java / Quarkus |
| ai-core      | 8001 | Python / FastAPI |
| dashboard    | 3000 | Next.js |
| valkey       | 6379 | Redis-compatible event bus |

> The feature specs under `docs/` mention 8080/8081 for db-writer in a
> couple of places (an earlier draft); the actual stack standardized on
> **8090** to avoid a port clash with api-gateway.

---

## Running the stack

Single entry point, controlled by `RUN_MODE` (default `local`):

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh                   # RUN_MODE=local — bare processes, no Docker
RUN_MODE=docker ./scripts/dev.sh   # Docker Compose stack instead
```

**Local mode** (`scripts/dev-local.sh`):
- Auto-detects a JDK 21 / Maven install if `JAVA_HOME`/`PATH` are stale.
- Starts Valkey/Redis on 6379 (skips if something's already listening).
- Starts db-writer (`mvn quarkus:dev`, 8090), waits for `/q/health/ready`.
- Starts api-gateway (`mvn quarkus:dev`, 8080).
- Starts ai-core (creates/reuses `.venv`, installs requirements, `uvicorn
  --reload`, 8001).
- Starts the dashboard (`npm install`, `npm run dev`, 3000).
- Writes each service's own log to `scripts/<service>.log`, **and** tees a
  tagged, interleaved copy of every line into `scripts/combined.log` — see
  [Logging, log levels & transaction tracing](#logging-log-levels--transaction-tracing).
- Stop with `Ctrl+C` or `./scripts/dev-stop.sh` from another shell.

**Docker mode**: `docker compose -f infrastructure/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
brings up all five containers with matching ports and healthchecks; each
service waits on its dependencies' `service_healthy` condition before
starting.

**Health checks** (either mode):

| Service     | Health URL                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| api-gateway | http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health     |
| db-writer   | http://localhost:8090/api/v1/health     |
| ai-core     | http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health     |
| dashboard   | http://localhost:3000/api/health        |

Quarkus services also expose `/q/health/live` and `/q/health/ready`.

**Running a single service directly** (e.g. against an already-running rest
of the stack):

```bash
cd services/ai-core && pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
cd apps/dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
cd services/api-gateway && mvn quarkus:dev
cd services/db-writer  && mvn quarkus:dev
```

## Services

### api-gateway (Java 21 / Quarkus, port 8080)

- **Adapters** (`com.uniserve.adapters.email`, `...whatsapp`) — turn a raw
  inbound message into the canonical `ChannelMessageReceived` event and
  publish it. Email polls IMAP on a schedule (`EmailAdapter.scheduledPoll`)
  using the same Gmail App Password as outbound SMTP; WhatsApp is a
  Meta Business webhook validated via HMAC-SHA256
  (`WhatsAppSignatureValidator`).
- **Auth** (`com.uniserve.auth`) — JWT issuance/refresh/logout, RBAC-scoped
  ticket/agent/tenant endpoints, and the public citizen status lookup
  (`PublicStatusResource`).
- **Events** (`com.uniserve.events`) — `EventBusPublisher` (XADD to Valkey
  Streams + DLQ routing on failure), `EventStreams` (stream name catalogue).
- Every adapter/publisher stage logs at INFO with the transaction's
  `traceId` — see the tracing section below.

### db-writer (Java 21 / Quarkus, port 8090)

- Sole owner of the SQLite file (`quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url`, WAL mode).
- Flyway-managed schema (`db/migration/V1__initial_schema.sql`, etc.) — see
  [Data model](#data-model).
- `InternalKeyFilter` — pod-to-pod auth: requires a matching `X-Internal-Key`
  header on every `/api/v1/db/*` request once `DB_WRITER_INTERNAL_API_KEY`
  is non-empty (a no-op in default local dev).
- `RequestLoggingFilter` — logs every `/api/v1/db/*` request (method, path,
  status, duration, and the caller's `X-Trace-Id` when supplied) at
  INFO/WARN/ERROR depending on status code.
- `TicketCache` — Caffeine read cache (max 1000 entries, 2-min TTL,
  hardcoded — not env-configurable despite similarly-named doc'd env vars).
- `POST /api/v1/db/tickets/{id}/messages` — append a message (citizen text or
  AI/agent reply) to a ticket's timeline; used by ai-core's ticket-creation
  pipeline to record the original complaint and any duplicate follow-ups.

### ai-core (Python 3.11 / FastAPI, port 8001)

- `app/events/dispatcher.py` — the live consumer loop: reads
  `channel.message.received` off Valkey and hands each event to
  `ConversationAgent.process()`.
- `app/conversation/agent.py` — identity gate (declines to proceed until the
  citizen is identified or explicitly anonymous), info-gathering follow-up
  questions, and either the OpenAI Assistants API path (tool-calling
  `confirm_identity`/`submit_complaint`) or a deterministic rule-based
  fallback when no LLM key is configured. For unverified channels (email),
  the rule-based path asks a structured intake question — Service/Customer
  ID, Mobile Number (10 digits), Name, Area Pin Code (6 digits), or "reply
  anonymous" — extracts each field by its label, validates the two numeric
  ones, and re-asks only for whatever's still missing or invalid. It
  remembers the original complaint text across that back-and-forth (saved to
  Valkey conversation state) so the ticket's initial message is the actual
  complaint, not the intake reply.
- `app/identity/resolver.py` + `db_client.py` — resolves a channel identity
  (phone/email/anonymous) to a canonical `master_id` via db-writer, merging
  across channels by matching phone/email.
- `app/notifications/sender.py` — consumes `ai.reply.send` (a third
  background consumer): actually delivers the conversation agent's replies
  (identity requests, follow-ups) via api-gateway's email send endpoint.
  This event used to be published with nothing consuming it — the citizen
  never received the identity-request email, so no reply was possible and no
  ticket could ever form. WhatsApp-origin replies are recorded as
  undeliverable (no outbound WhatsApp send in this codebase — Phase 2). The
  identity-request message also tells the citizen their ticket will be
  auto-closed after 14 days without a reply (see
  [Queue separation & ticket lifecycle](#queue-separation--ticket-lifecycle)
  below). The same module's `send_ticket_ack_email` sends a structured
  acknowledgment — carrying the ticket ID/number, category, and status — as
  soon as a ticket is created or a message is appended to an existing one
  (called from `dispatcher.py`'s `complaint.ready` handler, right after
  `create_ticket_from_complaint` succeeds).
- `app/tickets/intake.py` — `ensure_ticket_stub`/`update_ticket_identity`:
  called from `dispatcher.py` the instant a `channel.message.received` event
  arrives, before the conversation agent even runs, so a ticket exists (and
  is visible somewhere in the dashboard) from the citizen's very first
  message — see
  [Queue separation & ticket lifecycle](#queue-separation--ticket-lifecycle).
- `app/tickets/service.py` — consumes `complaint.ready` (a second background
  consumer): runs the dedup check, scores priority, and either updates the
  stub ticket already created for this thread in place, or appends the
  message to a different existing open ticket it deduped against (in which
  case the thread's own stub is linked as a duplicate rather than left
  stranded pending forever). Falls back to creating a fresh ticket only for
  callers that bypass the live pipeline (direct/test calls with no stub).
- `app/classify`, `app/pii`, `app/priority`, `app/dedup` — classification,
  PII scrubbing, priority scoring, and cross-channel dedup; each is also
  exposed as a standalone internal HTTP endpoint for direct testing, and
  `dedup`/`priority`/`classify` are also used in-process by the ticket
  pipeline above (PII scrubbing is not yet wired into the automatic flow).
- Every stage logs at INFO with the transaction's `traceId` (see below);
  `DbWriterClient` sends it onward as `X-Trace-Id` on every call to
  db-writer.

### dashboard (Next.js 14, port 3000)

- `src/app/page.tsx` — landing page (agent sign-in / track-a-complaint
  links).
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` — agent login.
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — role-gated agent dashboard (Analytics /
  Ticket Queue / Administration). Analytics is still a placeholder (no charts
  wired yet); Ticket Queue rows link to the detail page below.
- `src/app/dashboard/tickets/[id]/page.tsx` — ticket detail: full
  conversation timeline (inbound citizen messages + outbound replies),
  internal notes, a status-transition control (enforces the mandatory-note
  rule), an "add note" form, and a "send update" form. Sending an update on
  an email-origin ticket calls `POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/reply`, which
  records the outbound message and actually emails the citizen via
  `EmailAdapter.sendReply` (WhatsApp-origin tickets record the message but
  have no outbound send wired yet — Phase 2).
- `src/app/status/[ref]/page.tsx` — public, unauthenticated, server-rendered
  citizen status lookup by `ANON-XXXX` ref or email; calls api-gateway's
  `GET /api/v1/public/status/{ref}` server-side.
- `src/app/api/*` — Next.js route handlers acting as a thin BFF: proxy to
  api-gateway, forwarding the JWT cookie.
- The fuller component library documented in
  [12_AGENT_DASHBOARD](docs/12_AGENT_DASHBOARD.md) (separate route groups,
  charts, filter panels) is scaffolded as the target design; the current
  Phase-1 implementation is functional-minimal — one role-gated page per
  area rather than the full page/component tree.

## Event bus & streams

Valkey (Redis-compatible) Streams, one stream per event type per tenant:
key format `{tenantId}:{streamName}`.

| Stream | Producer → Consumer | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `channel.message.received` | api-gateway → ai-core | New inbound message, any channel |
| `identity.resolved` | ai-core → ai-core, db-writer | Citizen identity confirmed/created |
| `identity.pending` | ai-core → ai-core | Identity gate awaiting a reply |
| `complaint.ready` | ai-core → ai-core (ticket pipeline) | Enough info gathered to file a ticket |
| `ticket.created` / `ticket.updated` | db-writer → dashboard, notifications | Ticket lifecycle |
| `ai.reply.send` | ai-core → ai-core (notification sender) → api-gateway | Outbound reply to actually send to the citizen |
| `dlq` | any consumer, on failure | Dead-letter queue for manual review |

- Java side: `EventBusPublisher` (`XADD` + `publishToDlq`).
- Python side: `BasePublisher`/`BaseConsumer` (`app/events/`) — automatic
  retry (`EVENT_BUS_MAX_RETRIES`, default 3) then dead-letter.
- Health: `GET /api/v1/health/eventbus` on api-gateway.
- **`complaint.ready` → ticket creation is wired** (`app/tickets/service.py`,
  consumed by a dedicated background consumer in ai-core): dedup check →
  priority scoring → `POST /api/v1/db/tickets` (+ an initial
  `POST .../messages`) for a new complaint, or a `POST .../messages` append
  onto the existing open ticket for a duplicate. See
  [06_to_10_AI_PIPELINE](docs/06_to_10_AI_PIPELINE.md).

---

## Data model

SQLite, WAL mode, Flyway-migrated (`services/db-writer/src/main/resources/db/migration/`).
See [05_TICKET_SCHEMA](docs/05_TICKET_SCHEMA.md) for full DDL.

| Table | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `tenants` | `id`, `name`, `slug` (unique), `deployment_mode`, `llm_provider`, `config_json` |
| `agents` | `id`, `tenant_id`, `name`, `email` (unique/tenant), `password_hash`, `role` (admin\|lead\|agent), `is_active` |
| `identity_profiles` | `id`, `tenant_id`, `master_id` (unique), `name`/`email`/`phone`, `channel_ids_json`, `is_anonymous`, `anon_ref_id` (e.g. `ANON-7X3K`), `merged_into` |
| `tickets` | `id`, `tenant_id`, `ticket_number` (e.g. `TKT-00142`), `identity_id`, `identity_status` (pending\|anonymous\|confirmed), `assigned_to`, `status` (open\|assigned\|in_progress\|resolved\|closed\|reopened), `category`/`subcategory`, `priority_score` (0–10), `priority_label`, `sentiment_score`, `channel_origin`, `thread_id`, `archived_at`, `is_duplicate`, `parent_ticket_id`, `sla_due_at` |
| `ticket_messages` | `channel`, `direction`, `author_type` (ai\|agent\|user\|system), `content`, `media_urls_json`, `is_ai_generated` |
| `ticket_notes` | `content`, `is_mandatory`, `transition_from`/`transition_to` |
| `ticket_events` | `event_type`, `actor_type`, `actor_id`, `meta_json` (full audit trail) |
| `identity_pending_queue` | `thread_id`, `channel`, `channel_identity_value`, `raw_message`, `timeout_at` (default 48h) |

**Ticket status flow:** `Open → Assigned → In-Progress → Resolved → Closed`,
with `Closed → Reopened → In-Progress`. Mandatory ≥20-character notes are
enforced (application layer) on In-Progress→Resolved, Resolved→Closed, and
Closed→Reopened.

**Dev seed logins** (tenant `t1`, "TNEB Demo"): `admin@tneb.demo` /
`Admin@123`, `lead@tneb.demo` / `Lead@123`, `agent@tneb.demo` / `Agent@123`.
Every service's `TENANT_ID` must default to `t1` for these logins to see any
data — every `.env`/`.env.local`/`.env.example`/docker-compose default was
originally `"default"` instead, a separate, empty-config tenant with no
seeded agents, so any data created by the live pipeline was invisible to
every dev login. Fixed (env defaults now `t1`; `V4__realign_default_tenant_data.sql`
moved any data that had already accumulated under `"default"`) — if you're
troubleshooting "logged in but see zero tickets" again, check
`TENANT_ID`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID` in whichever `.env.local` actually loaded.

**`tickets.identity_id` caveat:** `identity_profiles` has two identifiers —
its primary key `id`, and a separate `master_id` business field. ai-core's
identity resolver (Feature 03 → the automatic `complaint.ready` → ticket
pipeline) always writes `master_id` into `tickets.identity_id`, and both
`PublicStatusResource` (citizen status lookup) and `GET /api/v1/db/identities/{id}`
(tries the primary key first, falls back to `master_id`) have been aligned
to that. **`IdentityService.merge()` was not** — it still reassigns tickets
by primary key, so if identity merging is ever wired into an automatic flow,
it needs the same `master_id` fix first. Not urgent today since nothing
currently triggers a merge automatically.

---

## Queue separation & ticket lifecycle

A ticket row now exists from the moment a channel message arrives — not
only once identity is confirmed and enough complaint detail is gathered.
This replaced an earlier gap where a citizen who emailed or WhatsApp'd in
saw nothing happen (no ticket, no visible record) until the entire
identity + complaint-gathering flow completed.

- **Stub creation.** `dispatcher.py`'s `channel.message.received` handler
  calls `ensure_ticket_stub` (`app/tickets/intake.py`) *before* handing the
  event to the conversation agent: it looks up a ticket already tracking
  this `threadId`, or creates a bare one (`identityStatus=pending`,
  `status=open`, no category yet). `tickets.thread_id` exists specifically
  for this — Valkey conversation state expires after
  `CONVERSATION_STATE_TTL_HOURS` (default 2h), far too short for a thread
  that might sit unconfirmed for days.
- **Update in place, never re-create.** As identity resolves and complaint
  details arrive, the *same* ticket row is updated (`update_ticket_identity`
  as soon as identity resolves; `create_ticket_from_complaint` fills in
  category/priority/etc. once the complaint is ready) — a thread never
  produces two ticket rows. If a complaint dedups to a *different* existing
  ticket, this thread's own stub is linked as a duplicate
  (`isDuplicate=1`, `parentTicketId=<canonical>`, `status=closed`) instead
  of being left stranded pending forever.
- **Two queues, one filter.** The dashboard's Ticket Queue passes
  `identityStatus=confirmed`; a separate Unconfirmed queue passes
  `identityStatus=pending,anonymous` (`GET /api/v1/tickets?identityStatus=`).
  A ticket crosses from Unconfirmed to the main queue automatically the
  moment its identity resolves — no manual move needed.
- **Two independent cleanup mechanisms** (don't confuse them):
  - **Auto-close (14 days, automatic).** `TicketAutoCloseScheduler`
    (api-gateway, `@Scheduled(every = "{ticket.auto-close.interval}")`,
    default hourly) calls db-writer's
    `POST /api/v1/db/tickets/auto-close-unconfirmed`, which transitions
    every `identityStatus=pending` ticket older than 14 days to
    `status=closed` (with a system note) — across every tenant, since it's
    a background schedule, not an admin action. Each closed ticket gets the
    same structured status-update email as a manual close (see
    [Citizen-facing notifications](#citizen-facing-notifications)) when an
    email address is on file.
  - **Archive-stale (60 days, admin-triggered).** A manual button in the
    dashboard's Administration tab (`admin.tickets.archive-stale` RBAC
    action) calls `POST /api/v1/tickets/archive-stale`, which soft-deletes
    (`archived_at` set, never physically deleted) tickets with
    `identityStatus in (pending, anonymous)` older than N days (default
    60). Archived tickets are hidden from every queue
    (`includeArchived=false` is the default on every list call) but remain
    fully retrievable with `includeArchived=true`.

## Citizen-facing notifications

Every citizen-facing email is structured (ticket ID/number, category,
status) and delivered through api-gateway's `EmailAdapter.sendReply` —
WhatsApp has no outbound send yet (Phase 2), so these are logged as
"not delivered" rather than sent for that channel.

- **Identity request.** Sent when the identity gate can't resolve who's
  writing in; now explicitly states the request will be auto-closed after
  14 days without a reply (`IDENTITY_REQUEST_MESSAGE`,
  `app/conversation/agent.py`).
- **Ticket acknowledgment.** Sent once a ticket is created *or* a message
  is appended to an existing one — carries the ticket ID/number, category,
  and status (`send_ticket_ack_email`, `app/notifications/sender.py`,
  called from `dispatcher.py`'s `complaint.ready` handler). Best-effort: a
  failed send never rolls back the ticket write.
- **Status update on resolve/close.** Sent only when a ticket transitions
  *to* `resolved` or `closed` — not on other transitions, and not for a
  standalone "add note" action — including the mandatory transition note's
  content (`TicketNotifier.sendStatusUpdateEmail`, api-gateway, shared by
  `TicketsResource`'s manual transition endpoint and
  `TicketAutoCloseScheduler`'s automatic 14-day close).

All three require an email address on file (either the ticket's
`channel_origin=email` with a resolved `identity_id`, or — for the
identity-request message — the raw address the citizen wrote in from) and
silently no-op otherwise (e.g. a WhatsApp-origin ticket, or a ticket that
never got far enough to have an identity record at all).

## HTTP API reference

### api-gateway — `http://localhost:8080`

**Health**
- `GET /api/v1/health` — aggregate health
- `GET /api/v1/health/eventbus` — Valkey connectivity + stream catalogue

**Auth**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` / `refresh` / `logout` / `forgot-password` / `reset-password`
- `GET /api/v1/auth/_dev/expired-token` — dev helper, mints an expired token

**Agent & tenant admin** (admin-only)
- `POST|GET /api/v1/agents`, `PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/agents/{id}`
- `GET|PUT /api/v1/tenant/config`

**Tickets** (RBAC-scoped: agents see their own, lead/admin see all)
- `GET /api/v1/tickets` (`?identityStatus=confirmed` for the main queue,
  `?identityStatus=pending,anonymous` for the Unconfirmed queue),
  `GET /api/v1/tickets/{id}` (detail includes the full message timeline and
  internal notes)
- `POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/transition` — on transition to `resolved` or
  `closed`, also sends the citizen a structured status-update email (see
  [Citizen-facing notifications](#citizen-facing-notifications))
- `GET/POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/notes` — internal, agent-facing annotations
- `POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/reply` — send an update to the citizen; records
  an outbound message and, for email-origin tickets, actually sends it
- `POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/generate-resolution-summary`
- `POST /api/v1/tickets/archive-stale` — admin-only
  (`admin.tickets.archive-stale`); soft-deletes unconfirmed tickets older
  than `olderThanDays` (default 60)

**Public citizen portal**

## Environment variables

Each service ships `.env.example` (Docker-friendly defaults) and
`.env.local.example` (local no-Docker defaults) under its own directory —
copy to `.env`/`.env.local` and fill in real values. **Never commit either.**

### api-gateway (prefix `GATEWAY_*`)
`APP_ENV`, `TENANT_ID`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `GATEWAY_HTTP_PORT`/`QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT`,
`GATEWAY_VALKEY_URL`, `AI_CORE_URL`, `DB_WRITER_URL`,
`DB_WRITER_INTERNAL_API_KEY` (shared pod-to-pod secret — must match
db-writer's and ai-core's own copy), `GATEWAY_MAIL_FROM`.
Email adapter: `EMAIL_SMTP_MOCK`, `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT`,
`EMAIL_SMTP_USER`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`,
`EMAIL_IMAP_HOST`, `EMAIL_IMAP_PORT`, `EMAIL_IMAP_MAILBOX`,
`EMAIL_IMAP_POLL_INTERVAL`, `EMAIL_IMAP_USER`, `EMAIL_IMAP_PASSWORD` (IMAP
user/password default to the SMTP credential if unset — one Gmail App
Password covers both directions).
WhatsApp adapter: `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET`,
`WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`.
Other: `DEV_SEED_ENABLED`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRY_ACCESS`, `JWT_EXPIRY_REFRESH`,
`TICKET_AUTO_CLOSE_INTERVAL` (default `1h` — how often the 14-day
unconfirmed-ticket auto-closer sweeps; see
[Queue separation & ticket lifecycle](#queue-separation--ticket-lifecycle)).

### db-writer (prefix `DB_WRITER_*`)
`APP_ENV`, `TENANT_ID`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `DB_WRITER_HTTP_PORT`/`QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT`,
`DB_WRITER_DB_PATH`, `DB_WRITER_INTERNAL_API_KEY` (empty = pod-to-pod auth
disabled, the local dev default), `BACKUP_DESTINATION`,
`BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES`. (`DB_WRITER_CACHE_MAX_SIZE`/`_TTL_MINUTES` are
documented in the feature spec but not actually read — `TicketCache.java`
hardcodes max 1000 / 2-min TTL.)

### ai-core (prefix `AI_CORE_*`)
`APP_ENV`, `TENANT_ID`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `AI_CORE_PORT`, `VALKEY_URL`,
`EVENT_BUS_MAX_RETRIES`, `EVENT_BUS_RETRY_DELAY_MS`,
`EVENT_BUS_CONSUMER_GROUP`, `DB_WRITER_URL`, `DB_WRITER_INTERNAL_API_KEY`,
`API_GATEWAY_URL` (delivers `ai.reply.send` via api-gateway's email endpoint),
`IDENTITY_MERGE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `IDENTITY_PENDING_TIMEOUT_HOURS`,
`IDENTITY_ANON_REF_PREFIX`, `DEFAULT_REGION`, `CONVERSATION_STATE_TTL_HOURS`,
`AI_MAX_FOLLOWUP_QUESTIONS`, `DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID` (empty = rule-based fallback),
`OPENAI_MODEL`, `PII_SCRUBBER_ENABLED`.

### dashboard
`APP_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL`
(browser-facing), `API_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_URL` (server-side/Docker-mode
container-name URL). No NextAuth — auth is a custom cookie set by
`app/api/auth/login/route.ts`, which proxies straight to api-gateway.

## Logging, log levels & transaction tracing

**Log level.** Every service reads `LOG_LEVEL` from its environment
(default `INFO`):
- api-gateway / db-writer: `quarkus.log.level=${LOG_LEVEL:INFO}`
  (`services/*/src/main/resources/application.properties`).
- ai-core: `settings.log_level` → `logging.basicConfig(level=...)`
  (`app/main.py`).

`INFO` (the default everywhere) surfaces info/warning/error — i.e.
"log everything" Phase 1 emits. Set `LOG_LEVEL=ERROR` in production to
silence routine info/warning traffic and keep only failures.

**Common log (local dev).** `scripts/dev-local.sh` writes each service's own
log (`scripts/<service>.log`, unchanged) **and** tees every line, tagged
with its source, into `scripts/combined.log`:
```
tail -f scripts/combined.log
```
shows every service's activity interleaved in the order it actually
happened — no need to tail four separate files to watch one transaction
move through the system.

**Transaction tracing (`traceId`).** Every inbound message is assigned a
`traceId` (a UUID) the moment an adapter receives it
(`EmailAdapter.parseMessage` / `WhatsAppParser.parse` on api-gateway). That
same id is carried through every downstream event and logged at each stage:

1. **api-gateway** — adapter receipt → `ChannelMessagePublisher.publish` →
   `EventBusPublisher.publish` (three INFO log lines, same `traceId`).
2. **ai-core** — `dispatcher.py`'s consumer logs receipt, `ConversationAgent`
   logs the turn start/decisions, `IdentityResolver` logs the resolution
   outcome, and every event it publishes (`identity.resolved`,
   `complaint.ready`, `ai.reply.send`) carries the same `traceId` (via
   `build_event(..., trace_id=...)` — previously each downstream event
   minted its own fresh, disconnected id; this was fixed alongside adding
   the logging).
3. **db-writer** — `ai-core`'s `DbWriterClient` sends the id onward as an
   `X-Trace-Id` header on every call; db-writer's `RequestLoggingFilter`
   logs it on every `/api/v1/db/*` request/response.

So `grep <traceId> scripts/combined.log` (or the individual per-service
logs) reconstructs one transaction end-to-end across all three backend
services. Log levels used throughout: **INFO** for normal progress (message
received, event published, resolution outcome, request succeeded), **WARN**
for recoverable problems (validation failure, DLQ routing, a 4xx from
db-writer), **ERROR** for failures (exceptions, a 5xx from db-writer, a
failed event publish).

**Known gap:** direct, non-event-driven HTTP flows (dashboard login, the
public status lookup, agent/ticket CRUD) don't have a `traceId` to carry,
since they aren't part of an adapter-originated transaction — db-writer's
`RequestLoggingFilter` logs `traceId=null` for those, which is expected.

---

## Testing

- **api-gateway / db-writer** (Java): `cd services/<service> && mvn test`
  (JUnit 5 + `@QuarkusTest`).
- **ai-core** (Python): `cd services/ai-core && pytest tests/ -q` (inside
  the service's `.venv`).
- **dashboard**: no automated test suite yet in Phase 1; verified manually
  through the browser and via the BFF route handlers.

## Dashboard app

See [Services → dashboard](#services) above for the current route layout,
and [12_AGENT_DASHBOARD](docs/12_AGENT_DASHBOARD.md) for the full target
design (route groups, component library, charts) versus what's actually
built today.

## Phase roadmap

**Phase 1 (built):** Email + WhatsApp channels; identity gate; basic PII
scrubbing; classification; priority scoring; SQLite WAL via db-writer; full
agent dashboard (functional-minimal UI); outbound email notifications;
dev mock seed data; JWT auth + RBAC; transaction tracing & log-level
control (this doc's [Logging](#logging-log-levels--transaction-tracing) section).

**Not yet wired despite existing code:** the rule-based (no-LLM) identity
gate recognises "anonymous" or a labeled reply to its structured intake
question (Service/Customer ID, Mobile, Name, Area Pin Code — see
[Services → ai-core](#services)), but nothing beyond that single-message
label matching — no real NLU, so e.g. an unlabeled value gets missed (the
OpenAI Assistants path handles free text correctly via tool-calling); IMAP
IDLE (real-time push) — polling only; outbound WhatsApp send (Meta Business
API) — `ai.reply.send` is delivered for email only, WhatsApp replies are
recorded as undeliverable.

**Phase 2 (planned, not built):** Twitter/IVR/WebChat channels; field-level
AES-256-GCM encryption for PII columns (`PiiEncryptionService`, KMS/Vault key
management, key rotation); SMS/webhook notifications; blind-index PII
search; enforced no-PII logging; JSON-structured log output in production
(`quarkus.log.console.json` is currently disabled in dev profile for
readability).

## Security notes

- JWT (HS256), 15-min access / 7-day rotating refresh tokens
  ([11_MULTI_TENANCY](docs/11_MULTI_TENANCY.md)).
- Three roles: `admin`, `lead`, `agent` — RBAC enforced in api-gateway.
- Pod-to-pod auth between api-gateway/ai-core → db-writer via a shared
  `X-Internal-Key` (`DB_WRITER_INTERNAL_API_KEY`), a no-op when unset (local
  dev default; Docker mode currently leaves it unset too — not yet enforced
  there).
- WhatsApp webhook signature validation (HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body); a
  fixed dev-only bypass token (`sha256=test_bypass_in_dev`) works only when
  `APP_ENV=development`.
- PII fields (`name`, `email`, `phone`, ticket `content`/`resolution`) are
  marked `PHASE_2_ENCRYPT` in the schema — encrypted at rest only from
  Phase 2 onward; Phase 1 stores them in plaintext SQLite columns.
- Never commit `.env`/`.env.local` files (gitignored); only `.env.example`/
  `.env.local.example` templates are tracked.
